Our new feature is to categorize each person according to their age as baby, child, teenager, adult, middle-age and elder. So our feature will walk through each person node, calculate the age and categorize it according to the criteria that is in the graph.jac file(get_categorization function).
When we were creating this new feature, at the start we used only if condition for each categories but it didn't work properly that means it only took elder and middle-age categories then by referring to the doc.jaseci.org we used elif condition for categorization.
Throughout this assignment, we have experienced how the walker age_categorization works in jaseci studio , identified ages of each person and category.
Now we familiarized with jaseci studio and coding part.
